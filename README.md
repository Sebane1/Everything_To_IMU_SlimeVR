A very rough and experimental attempt to make PS5 Dualsense controllers work as SlimeVR trackers.
This repository currently exists for fellow developers to help test, troubleshoot, and iron out tracking data bugs.

Have Slime VR Server and PS5 controllers turned on and connected via bluetooth before running the code (Expect bugs).
